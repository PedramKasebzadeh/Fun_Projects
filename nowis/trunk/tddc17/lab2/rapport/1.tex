\section{States and Actions}
In the vacuum cleaner domain, the states are all moving element in the world, so a state can be describe by :
\begin{itemize}
  \item the vaccum cleaner position (x, y)
  \item his direction
  \item the cell is withy or not
\end{itemize}

All other things in this world like walls, home position are static and so are the same for all states.

The actions in this world is simple all the action that the vacuum cleaner can do : 
\begin{itemize}
  \item turn right
  \item turn left
  \item move forward
  \item suck dirt
  \item stop
\end{itemize}

The sensors of the vacuum cleaner are not actions.
