\section{Breadth First Search and Uniform Cost Search}
There's no difference between BFS and UCS when the cost of each action is 1 because UCS explore the (unexplored) node which is the nearest from the start node. It will result that the UCS will explore the tree level by level starting by the top node. So it's exactly the same exploration as BFS.

If, at first goal depth, there is more than 1 goal, then the algorithm may return different path but will get the same score (depending on the way the two algorithm select actions which will lead to the same cost).

  \subsection{Results}
So, in this world, we can observe that BFS and UCS always get the same score.

They don't choose exactly the same path because we can see that BFS suck dirt first and that UCS suck dirt just before leaving a cell.
So, in that case UCS seams to explore more nodes than BFS but they obviously stop exploration at the same depth of the tree.
