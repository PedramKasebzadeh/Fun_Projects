\subsection{Cities}

Now we will try to increase the number en cities. And so, we also must increase the number of location. One office and one airport per city. The basic problem is the same as before, with 4 objects to move.

  \subsubsection{FF planer}

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
  \hline
  number of cities & total time & evaluated states (max depth) \\ \hline
  4  & 6.14s & 1823 (13) \\ \hline
  10 & 22.95s & 1823 (13) \\ \hline
  15 & 50.44s & 1823 (13) \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

Same remarks. See previously section \ref{location_ff}
