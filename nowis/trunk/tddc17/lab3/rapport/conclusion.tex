\section{Conclusion}

All these experiments showed that FF planner always explored the same number of states if we add dummies objects (like new cities, locations or packet which are not involved in the goal). But spend more time evaluating each node, evaluating with these dummies objects.

Unlike FF planer, IPP take cares about these dummies and try more actions when there's more dummies objects. But IPP planner seems to be able to handle more packet when FF planner is not.
