### Problem Definition ###
There's 2 problem definition, the second one simply extend the first domain definition by adding more steps to the move actions thus to make the carrier useful. Otherwise, it's easier to simple move crate by crate without using the carrier. This make plan harder to found.



### Mutual exclusion ###
Both domain definition (emergency and emergency2) are already have sufficient mutual exclusion constraint.
As in the example with the rover, the move change the location of a copter and all action require a specific location. So the move action could not be used in concurrency with others actions.
To move something, a copter have to pick-up and then to put-down a crate or a carrier. So there is an atom called "loaded" which become true with pick-up and false with put-down. This make impossible the concurrency of different pick-up and put-down with the same copter.
